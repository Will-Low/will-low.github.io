      <description>I started doing code katas when I started learning TDD. At the time, I thought their purposes was to learn how to solve the problem at hand. Over time, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate that this is not the goal of doing katas.
What is a Kata? A kata is simple programming scenario. They are similar to what many refer to as &amp;ldquo;LeetCode&amp;rdquo; exercises, but with a completely different end goal. Instead of trying to solve a novel problem, a kata is an exercise you solve and then repeat over and over again.</description>

      <description>a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Mastering TDD&amp;rdquo; a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Advanced TDD&amp;rdquo;
For the past 9 months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on learning test-driven development (TDD). This is easier said than done. While the principles of TDD are easy, fluency (not that I can claim it) is challenging. I continue to meet people who have given up because the learning process has been too hard. I think this is largely due to the lack of intermediate materials.</description>
