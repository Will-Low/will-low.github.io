  <p>When unit testing, it is common to leverage &ldquo;test doubles&rdquo;, which are pieces of code intended to replace references to production code in your tests. This can ease the burden of setting up your test and better isolate the system-under test from surrounding components.</p>
<p>One type of test double has historically been referred to as a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;, which is a test double that is included to ensure compliance with the API, but is not leveraged for anything. This term should no longer have a place in our code, given its derogatory and ableist nature.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the term &ldquo;test double&rdquo; was intended to draw parallel&rsquo;s to stunt doubles in the film industry. I would propose then that we borrow another term from the film industry: &ldquo;stand-in&rdquo;. A stand-in is a person positioned where the actor will be, in order for the scene to be lit and the camera to be placed prior to the actor arriving on set.</p>
<p>A few issues with this term could be confusion with &ldquo;standard input&rdquo; (stdin) and the hyphenated nature makes it a bit challenging to work with in a snake-case or camel-case file. Another term that could be a good fit could be &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo;. Whatever option we choose is fine by me. The goal here is to make sure we make our code, our companies, and our communities inviting for people of all abilities.</p>
